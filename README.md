# NES Zelda
## The project i thought I deleted!
##Somehow an udacity course I was working on got mixed up with all this... Thats why it says that there are 84 contributors lol.  (They have great tutorials!)

I thought i deleted this all (I did, don't use git clean unless you know what you are doing) but found an older version on my onedrive!  Theres some whacky stuff that ended up in this but it seems everyhthing is here.  I wouldn't recomend pulling from this repo just because I think some other (needless) files got uploaded as well.

This is the first stage of the original Zelda game for NES.  I added some alternative functions (such as a health and mana bar, giving link magic and bullets and adding a merchant!).  I also added some neat things in the dungeon area: there's a knight mini-boss.  

I'm currently working on a better version of this project.  Many of the ways I implemented things (such as not using animators or the built in unity physics) could be re done better.  And I'm doing just that!  

There is another repo that I have that contains an updated version of this project I'm working on.
